### Session 2.1 - Installing your dev environment

Checklist to get tooling installed:

* install vscode (win/mac: download and install) -> see it starts
* verify what is installed from vscode terminal: `git --version`, win: `python --version`, mac `python3 --version`, `node --version`
* install tooling managing programmer tooling on mac: homebrew
* install tooling: git (win: download&install, mac: `brew install git`)
* install programming languages: python (win: download&install, mac: `brew install python3.11`)
* install programming languages: nodejs (win: download&install, mac: `brew install node`
* verify what is installed from vscode terminal: `git --version`, win: `python --version`, mac `python3 --version`, `node --version`

Checklist for further configuring tooling:

* add local folder and open folder in vscode
* change terminal on windows: git bash or cmd over powershell
* add simple file.py with `print('whatever')` in it and run it from terminal with `python file.py`
* sandbox your folder as python virtual environment with `python -m venv .venv`
* activate your virtual environment (win: restart terminal, mac: `source .venv/bin/activate`
* install dependencies: pytest (win/mac: `pip install pytest`)
* create simple test_file.py with one test method `def test_method(): pass`
* run tests from terminal with `pytest test_file.py`
* define pytest as test framework for test lab in vscode to see test_files and test_method() in runner
* create requirements.txt file and write in dependencies, each on own line: `pytest`, `playwright`, `pytest-playwright`
* install repo dependencies based on requirements.txt with `pip install -r requirements.txt` on terminal
* install playwright node tooling with `playwright install on terminal
* clone a project from github and open that folder in vscode, sandbox with virtual environment as before
* make changes in files, try commit&sync in vscode
* to commit successfully, define git.name and git.email from terminal [how to](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-configure-git-username-and-email/)

Extra practice:

* learn to navigate folders with `cd ..` and `cd folder_name` and check files in folder with win: `dir`, mac: `ls` / `ls -la`
* learn to use autocomplete - write only max 3 letters and allow tab to autocomplete

Extra test playwright operational without sample project:

* create test_playwright.py -file with `from playwright_sync_api import Page` and `def test_pw(page: Page):` and `page.goto("https://exploratorytestingacademy.com")` each on own line as the skeleton test case
* run tests `pytest --headed test_playwright.py`
